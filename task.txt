Job Description

I need a simple scraper that will convert all the domains in the marketplace into a textfile for me.

The one feature it needs is I must be able to select a price range.

Price Range ($)

So say I want to scrape all the domains with price range from 5 - 20. It needs to download all them domains into file listed like this:
name.com
name.com
name.com
name.com
name.com
name.com

I am hoping to get this small script done for cheap. I don't need anything else but this.
